# I use Jekyll to post my notes!

Today I decided to add these Notes to my website using Jekyll. I thought it would be more convenient to write code snippets in markdown than in HTML and I already use GitHub to serve my website.

## Installation

### Ruby
```
# Update package list
sudo apt update

# Install Ruby and development tools
sudo apt install ruby-full build-essential zlib1g-dev

# Add Ruby gems configuration to zsh config file (change .zshrc to .bashrc when using bash)
echo '# Install Ruby Gems to ~/gems' >> ~/.zshrc
echo 'export GEM_HOME="$HOME/gems"' >> ~/.zshrc
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/gems/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc

# Verify Ruby installation
ruby -v
gem -v
``` 

### Jekyll

```
# Now install Jekyll
gem install jekyll bundler

# Create Gemfile (in my root)
echo 'source "https://rubygems.org"
gem "github-pages", group: :jekyll_plugins' > Gemfile

# Install dependencies
bundle install

# Run Jekyll locally
bundle exec jekyll serve

# Visit http://localhost:4000
``` 

**Quick Jekyll Setup:**

```
# In the website repo
mkdir _posts
mkdir _layouts

# Write posts as:
# _posts/2025-01-15-<title>.md

# Jekyll converts to:
# /2025/01/15/<title>.html
```


## Some Confusions using Jekyll

Jakell is a site generator. It generates `_site` and what's inside for me, so make sure that I don't edit what's there. It is good to differentiate source files and build output. 

**What I EDIT (source files):**
```
my-website/
├── _config.yml
├── _layouts/
│   ├── default.html
│   └── post.html
├── _posts/
│   └── 2025-01-15-<title>.md   ← I edit this
├── notes/
│   └── index.html              ← I edit this
|── index.html
├── favicon.ico
└── images/
```

**What Jekyll GENERATES (build output):**
```
my-portfolio/
└── _site/                   ← Jekyll creates this automatically
    ├── notes/
    │   └── index.html       ← Generated from my notes/index.html
    ├── 2025/01/15/
    │   └── functional-programming/
    │       └── index.html   ← Generated from my markdown post
    ├── index.html
    └── ...
```

So the take away is `_site` is  
- Auto-generated by Jekyll - never edit files here
- Deleted and rebuilt every time Jekyll runs
- This is what gets served locally and deployed to GitHub Pages
- Should be in .gitignore (don't commit it to GitHub)

Given this in mind, the **workflow** should look like

1. Edit my source files (notes/index.html, _posts/*.md, etc.)
2. Jekyll builds and puts output in _site/
3. Browser serves from _site/ locally
4. GitHub Pages rebuilds _site/ automatically when I push
5. I only commit source files, not _site/

I still haven't gotten syntax highlight to work inside code blocks. I will continue tomorrow...

## Side note on .gitignore

I added `_site` to the `.gitignore` file, but git still tracked files inside `_site`. It turns out that `gitignore` _does not untrack files_. It only prevents tracking new ones. I must have committed `_site` to the repository at some point and git will continue to track it even after I added it to `.gitignore`. 

**How to fix it**

1. Remove `_site` from tracking
```
git rm -r --cached _site
```
- --cached = remove from Git, not from your filesystem
- -r = recursive

2. Commit the change
```
git commit -m "stop tracking _site"
```

3. Verify
```
git status
```
