<!-- <p>Welcome!</p> -->

<p>I am a graduate student at University of Hawaii, studying
computer science, logic, and math.
More specifically, my focus is on programming languages and
the theoretical foundations of computer science.
<!-- As I learn more about computer -->
<!-- science, I find myself drawn to its theoretical foundations.-->

<p>
The act of programming (especially functional programming) is fun
and obviously very useful, but the underlying logic and structure of
programs is more compelling to me, and this is what drives my study and
research in computer science.
